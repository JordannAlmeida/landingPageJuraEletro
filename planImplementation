# Next.js Landing Page Implementation Plan

Project Goal: Create a high-performing, SEO-friendly static landing page for "Technical Electric Services" to attract clients via Google search and facilitate contact through WhatsApp or Instagram.

Technology Stack:

-    Framework: Next.js (for static site generation next export)
-    UI Library: React
-    Styling: Choose one: Tailwind CSS (recommended for utility-first approach and speed), CSS Modules, or Styled Components.
-    Deployment: Vercel (seamless integration with Next.js) or Netlify.

## Phase 1: Setup & Core Structure (1-2 Days)

### Next.js Project Initialization:

    npx create-next-app@latest your-company-name --use-pnpm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-tailwindcss" (if using Tailwind, otherwise remove --example)
    Clean up boilerplate files (styles, api, etc.) to keep it lean for a static site.

### Basic Page Structure (pages/index.js):

    Create a single index.js file for your landing page.

### Component Architecture:

    Establish a components directory for reusable UI elements (e.g., Header, Footer, HeroSection, ServicesSection, ContactSection).

    Styling Setup:

    Configure your chosen styling solution (e.g., install Tailwind CSS and run npx tailwindcss init -p).

    Favicon & Basic Assets:

    Add your company logo as a favicon and any initial brand assets to the public directory.

## Phase 2: Content & UI Development (3-5 Days)

### Hero Section:

    Headline: Clear, concise, and keyword-rich (e.g., "Reliable Electrical Services & Solar Panel Installation in Pimenta - MG").
    Sub-headline: Briefly explain what you do (owner + helpers, residential, solar power plants).
    Strong Call-to-Action (CTA): "Get a Free Quote," "Contact Us Today."
    Contact Buttons: Prominently feature buttons for WhatsApp and Instagram.
        WhatsApp: https://wa.me/37999451323?text=Olá,%20gostaria%20de%20um%20orçamento.
        Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/jurandir.alves
    High-Quality Image/Video: Showcase your work (solar panels, electrical work) or a team photo.

### Services Section:

    Detail your main services: general electrical services, solar panel installation, solar power plant solutions.
    Use bullet points or short paragraphs with icons for easy readability.
    Highlight benefits (safety, efficiency, cost savings).

### About Us Section:

    Introduce "Technical Electric" – owner-operated, experienced, dedicated.
    Mention "helpers" to give a sense of team and capacity.
    Briefly state your mission or values (e.g., quality, reliability, customer satisfaction).

### Why Choose Us / Differentiators:

    Highlight unique selling points (e.g., "experienced owner," "local service," "guaranteed work").

### Call to Action (Repeat):

    Place another CTA with WhatsApp/Instagram buttons towards the bottom of the page.

### Footer:

    Company Name, Copyright, Privacy Policy (if applicable), essential contact links (repeat WhatsApp/Instagram).

## Phase 3: SEO & Performance Optimization (2-3 Days)

This is crucial for Google searchability!

    Metadata (in pages/_document.js or next/head):

    <title> Tag: Unique, keyword-rich (e.g., "Technical Electric Services | Solar Panel Installation | [Your City]").
    <meta name="description">: Compelling summary with keywords (e.g., "Expert electrical services and solar panel installation by Technical Electric. Owner-operated, reliable, and serving [Your City]. Get a free quote today!").
    <meta name="keywords"> (less impactful now, but can be included): comma-separated relevant terms.
    Open Graph (og:) Tags: For social media sharing (title, description, image, URL).

    Structured Data (Schema.org):

    Implement JSON-LD schema for your business type (e.g., LocalBusiness, Electrician, SolarEnergyInstaller). This helps Google understand your business. Use next/script for this.
    Include business name, address, phone, services, opening hours, reviews (if any).

    Keyword Research & Integration:

    Identify primary keywords (e.g., "electrician [city]", "solar panel installation [city]", "electrical repairs [city]").
    Naturally integrate these keywords into your headlines, sub-headlines, and body content.

    Image Optimization:

    Use next/image component for automatic image optimization (lazy loading, responsive images, WebP format).
    Add descriptive alt text to all images for accessibility and SEO.

    Page Speed & Performance:

    Next.js already provides excellent performance out of the box (pre-rendering, code splitting).
    Minimize CSS and JavaScript.
    Ensure all images are optimized.
    Regularly test with Google PageSpeed Insights and Lighthouse.

    Internal Linking:

    While it's a single page, ensure CTAs are clear and point to your contact methods.

    Sitemap (sitemap.xml) & Robots (robots.txt):

    For a single-page site, a sitemap.xml is simple but good practice. Generate one (e.g., using a small script or manually) and place it in the public directory.
    Create a robots.txt file in the public directory to guide search engine crawlers (usually Allow: /).

    Responsive Design:

    Ensure the page looks great and functions perfectly on all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop). Use media queries or a responsive framework like Tailwind CSS.

## Phase 4: Deployment & Monitoring (1 Day)

### Build Static Files:

    next build then next export to generate the out directory containing your static HTML, CSS, and JS files.

    Deployment:

    Vercel: Connect your GitHub repository. Vercel automatically detects Next.js and deploys your static site.
    Netlify: Similar to Vercel, connect your repo, set build command to next build && next export, and publish directory to out.
    Configure a custom domain.

    Google Search Console:

    Verify your site ownership.
    Submit your sitemap.xml.
    Monitor indexing status, crawl errors, and search performance.

    Google Analytics (Optional):

    Integrate Google Analytics to track page views, user engagement, and traffic sources.

### Key Success Factors for Client Search & Contact:

    Prominent CTAs: Make the WhatsApp and Instagram buttons visually stand out and easy to find.
    Clear Value Proposition: Immediately convey what you do and why you're the best choice.
    Local SEO: Incorporate your service area (city, region) throughout the content and in metadata.
    Fast Loading Speed: A quick site keeps users engaged and is favored by Google.
    Mobile-First Design: A significant portion of searches happen on mobile devices.
    Direct Contact Links: Ensure the WhatsApp and Instagram links are correctly formatted and lead directly to interaction.

By following this plan, you'll create a robust, performant, and search-engine-friendly landing page that effectively drives clients to contact your business.
